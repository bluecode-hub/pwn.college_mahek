# Secret of Polygot
in the xtart of the cgallenge we download the pdf and when we open it we find the second half of the flag
then we insepect the image in the file command and even we open hexedit and see that the file is a png also so we use mv to change the file type to png and we get the first half of the flag
## Solve
- in the flag to flag pdf 1n_pn9_&_pdf_2a6a1ea8} this part of the flag is there
- in the image we find the first half of the flag we get this flag as whole image
- went to the the pdf to get the second half of the flag after that used 
wget  the url     to  get the file in local system downloaded
after that i  did mv the file from pdf to png and used eog(linux way bto view image) to show the file
