# Into to Burpsuite
in this challenge i learnt the basics of burpsuite how it works and what and all we nned to pass a packet
for the first chalenge i intercepted the packets using burpsuite. when a packet came i checket that if we removed the field of otp we are able to bypass the packet
without an otp so i did that and got the flag
