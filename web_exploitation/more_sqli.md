## Solve 
- to bypass the the first injection we need to first overcome the password in the login page for that i used a ' OR 1=1 -- - as the password that helped in braking the login
- i tried a lot of comination but then understood the patten that it follows so i used that and bypassed the login page
- the next part was to find the flag in the databse for that i used to sl commands i used the official document of sqlite to search for the syntanx of sqlitite i saw that the database wa vulnerable to the union function so after that with each location given in the main database on the site
- i gave this command Algiers' UNION SELECT sql,1,1 FROM sqlite_master;-- and then with Lagos only with lagas it gave me a table which has the flag iin the third row ka description.
- sql master is like the syntax that gives the information of the off all the columns from the database
